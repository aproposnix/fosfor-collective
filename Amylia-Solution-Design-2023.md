# Amylia, My Life Assistant



## Introduction

Amylia (a recursive acronym for Amylia's my life assistant) is a personal health and Fitness data solution that allows users to collect and combine data from multiple sources (for example, fitness trackers, hear rate readers, scales, pressure cuffs, etc) in order to build a personalized health and fitness dataset based on the specific requirements of the user. 

Amylia is NOT a clinical tool used by health professionals (though it can be, they are just not the target audience). Instead, Amylia is about empowering users to collect there own personal health and fitness data into a single dataset, allowing the user to analyze the data for new insights. It will provide modern data visualization techniques in order to make complex topics understandable to a broad group of individuals 

Main benefits: 

- Amylia is NOT a corporate owned cloud solution. 
- Provides an Alternative to Big Tech health solutions which are notorious for mining user data
- Privacy Focused
