# Proposal: Creating a Public Interest Technology Organization

<!--fosfor collective proposal development--> 

## Executive Summary 

**Public Interest Technology** (PIT) is technology used to serve the public good and to address social challenges. This proposal outlines a vision for a Public Interest Technology collective that is committed to developing solutions that serve in the public interests. The proposed organization seeks to address multiple challenges facing society today by developing solutions to mitigate the impact of those risks and issues. Some challenges the organization aims to address include: 

- The impact of an aging population combined with fewer available medical professionals on organized society.[ðŸ”´ Rewrite needed]
- Lack of control of personal health data
- Lack of tools needed to make educated decisions about ones own health [ðŸ”´ Rewrite]
- A "for-profit mentality" in the health industry that prioritizes financial gain over public health
- A lack of a holistic approach to personal health that can contribute to poor health outcomes
- Lack of health equity that leads to disparities in healthcare access and outcomes

We propose to develop non-proprietary solutions that are open, transparent, and community driven. Our solutions aim to empower individuals to take control of their life by providing them with tools that offer a holistic view of their health, enabling them to make informed decisions about their lifestyle and wellbeing. 

By joining forces with like minded individuals who are passionate about using technology for social good, we can create technology solutions that are:

- **Accessible** and inclusive, serving diverse communities and populations
- **Equitable**, addressing disparities in healthcare access and outcomes
- **Impactful**, making a positive impact on individuals and society as a whole

Together, we can build an organization that is committed to serving the public interest and making a positive impact on individuals and society as a whole. We invite individuals who share our vision and passion for using technology for social good to join us in building this organization.

## Problem Statement

Public Health is facing numerous challenges, including a shortage of healthcare professionals, an aging population and disparities in access and outcomes.  These challenges are further exacerbated by proprietary and privacy invasive health technologies that limit individual control over personal health data, exclude underrepresented groups, and prioritize profit over public health and well being. Developing community driven technologies that prioritize public accessibility, inclusivity, and health equity while empowering individuals to take control of their health data and decisions, is critical to addressing these challenges.

- **Aging Population** : The WHO has estimated that by 2050 the number of persons 60+ year will be 2 billion. This will likely cause burdens on the already burdened healthcare systems.  Therefore, it is essential to address the needs of this growing population and develop effective solutions to ensure healthy aging and overall wellbeing. 
- **Fewer Medical Professionals**: With fewer doctors with more patients, it means that there will be very little interaction between the doctor and the patients. This creates a challenge as.....
- **Lack of transparency**: Especially as AI becomes increasingly prevalent in user applications, it is important that there is a level of transparency on how an individuals data will be used by the algorithms behind it. If there is a lack of transparency, individuals may not know what data is being collected, how it is being used, or who it is being shared with. This lack of understanding can make it difficult for individuals to make informed decisions about what data they are willing to share and with whom. Furthermore it create an atmosphere of distrust. 
- **Lack of Data Control**: With most health technologies being proprietary, closed and designed for obsolescence,  individuals have limited control over their personal health data. This lack of control can limit their ability to make informed decisions about their health and thus preventing them from improving their outcomes. To be clear, we are not referring to clinical data but only personally collected data. [ðŸ”´ Further rework it]
- **Lack of health equity**: Proprietary health technologies can also exclude underrepresented groups, such as low income individuals and people with disabilities, who may not be able to afford or have access to these technologies. This can worsen existing health disparities and contribute to poorer health outcomes for these groups.
- **Lack of "Cloudless" Solutions** - We propose the creation of federated applications that can communicate with one another in order to share data between apps. We are committed to building forward in our design. We are too over dependent on cloud solutions which increases the odds that your data will be stolen. 
- Mental health often overlooked - There is still a lot of stigma in the world regarding mental health disorders. Physical and mental health are connected. We need to have a more holistic approach to mental health care. 

In response to these challenges, our proposed Public Interest Technology organization aims to develop open, transparent, and community driven technologies that truly serve the public interest and can improve health outcomes for individuals and communities.
