# Proposal: Creating a Public Interest Technology Organization

## Executive Summary 

This proposal outlines a vision for a Public Interest Technology collective that is committed to developing solutions that serve in the public interests. The proposed organization seeks to address multiple challenges facing society today by developing solutions to mitigate the impact of those risks and issues. Some challenges the organization aims to address include: 

- The impact of an aging population combined with fewer available medical professionals on organized society.
- Lack of access to privacy focused decentralized solutions 
- ~~A lack of privacy focused alternatives to big tech providers~~
- A "for-profit mentality" in the health industry that prioritizes financial gain over public health
- A lack of a holistic approach to personal health that can contribute to poor health outcomes
- Lack of health equity that leads to disparities in healthcare access and outcomes

We propose to develop non-proprietary solutions that are open, transparent, and community-driven. Our solutions aim to empower individuals to take control of their life by providing them with tools that offer a holistic view of their health, enabling them to make informed decisions about their lifestyle and well-being. 

By joining forces with like-minded individuals who are passionate about using technology for social good, we can create technology solutions that are:

- **Accessible** and inclusive, serving diverse communities and populations
- **Equitable**, addressing disparities in healthcare access and outcomes
- **Impactful**, making a positive impact on individuals and society as a whole

Together, we can build an organization that is committed to serving the public interest and making a positive impact on individuals and society as a whole. We invite individuals who share our vision and passion for using technology for social good to join us in building this organization.

## Problem Statement

Public Health is facing numerous challenges, including a shortage of healthcare professionals, an aging population and disparities in access and outcomes.  These challenges are further exacerbated by proprietary, closed and privacy-invasive health technologies that limit individual control over personal health data, exclude underrepresented groups, and prioritize profit over public health and well being. Developing community-driven health technologies that prioritize accessibility, inclusivity, and health equity, and empowering individuals to take control of their health data and decisions, is critical to addressing these challenges.

- **Limited control over personal health data**: With most health technologies being proprietary and closed, individuals have limited control over their personal health data. This lack of control can limit their ability to make informed decisions about their health and to access personalized care and support.
- **Lack of interoperability**: The lack of interoperability between different health technologies can also pose a challenge for individuals who want to aggregate and analyze their personal health data. Without standardized formats and protocols for data sharing, individuals may struggle to make sense of their data and to use it to inform their health decisions.
- **Exclusion of underrepresented groups**: Proprietary and closed health technologies can also exclude underrepresented groups, such as low-income individuals and people with disabilities, who may not be able to afford or access these technologies. This can exacerbate existing health disparities and contribute to poorer health outcomes for these groups.
- **Lack of transparency and accountability**: The lack of transparency and accountability in the development and deployment of health technologies can also pose a challenge for individuals and communities. With little visibility into how these technologies work and how they use personal health data, individuals may be hesitant to trust them and to use them to inform their health decisions.
- **Focus on profit over public health**: Big tech companies in the health sector prioritize revenue streams over public health, often neglecting the development of technologies that truly serve the public interest and improve health outcomes. Moreover, public funds are frequently allocated to proprietary solutions that offer limited value to the general public without additional payment, exacerbating health disparities and leading to poorer health outcomes for underrepresented and vulnerable populations. To address these challenges, it is critical to develop and promote community-driven health technologies that prioritize accessibility, inclusivity, and health equity, while empowering individuals to take control of their health data and decisions.

These challenges are significant and can contribute to a lack of trust in health technologies. As a result, there is a pressing need for a Public Interest Technology organization that can develop open, transparent, and community-driven technologies that truly serve the public interest and can improve health outcomes for individuals and communities.
