## Summary 

**Public Interest Technology** (PIT) is technology used to serve the public good and to address social issues. This proposal outlines a vision for creating a Public Interest Technology collective, Fosfor, which will be committed to developing solutions that serve in the public interest. Fosfor seeks to address multiple challenges facing society today by developing solutions to mitigate the impact of those risks and issues. Some challenges the organization aims to address include: 

- The impact of fewer medical professionals on an aging society 
- Lack of control of personal health data
- Individuals lacking the tools to fully utilize their personally collected health data 
- A "for-profit mentality" in the health industry that prioritizes financial gain over public health

- Lack of health equity that leads to disparities in healthcare access and outcomes

We propose to develop non-proprietary solutions that are open, transparent, and community driven. Our solutions aim to empower individuals to take control of their life by providing them with tools that offer a holistic view of their health, enabling them to make informed decisions about their lifestyle and wellbeing. 

By joining forces with like minded individuals who are passionate about using technology for social good, we can create technology solutions that are:

- **Accessible** and inclusive, serving diverse communities and populations
- **Equitable**, addressing disparities in healthcare access and outcomes
- **Impactful**, making a positive impact on individuals and society as a whole

Together, we can build an organization that is committed to serving the public interest and making a positive impact on individuals and society as a whole. We invite individuals who share our vision and passion for using technology for social good to join us in building this organization.

## Problem Statement

Public Health is facing numerous problems, including a shortage of healthcare professionals, an aging population and disparities in access and outcomes.  These challenges are further exacerbated by proprietary and privacy invasive health technologies that limit individual control over personal health data, exclude underrepresented groups, and prioritize profit over public health and well being. Developing technologies that prioritize public accessibility, inclusivity, and health equity while empowering individuals to take control of their health data and decisions, is critical to addressing these challenges.

- **Aging Population** : The WHO has estimated that by 2050 the number of persons 60+ year will be 2 billion. This will likely cause burdens on the already burdened healthcare systems.  Therefore, it is essential to address the needs of this growing population and develop effective solutions to ensure healthy aging and overall wellbeing. 
- **Fewer Medical Professionals**: The impact of fewer health professionals combined with an aging population can result in an overwhelmed healthcare system, with longer wait times for medical attention, fewer resources available for patient care, and limited access to medical professionals. This can lead to poorer health outcomes for individuals and a strain on the healthcare system as a whole. It is vitally important to empower people with the tools needed to mitigate the resulting issues. 
- **Lack of Transparency and Data Control**: Proprietary health technologies often limit user knowledge about data collection, usage and sharing. This hinders informed decisions and control over personal health data. Ensuring transparency and individual control is essential for building trust and enabling informed health decisions.
- **Lack of health equity**: Proprietary health technologies can also exclude underrepresented groups, such as low income individuals and people with disabilities, who may not be able to afford or have access to these technologies. This can worsen existing health disparities and contribute to poorer health outcomes for these groups.
- **Lack of decentralized services** - Cloud solutions are everywhere but it's often foisted onto consumers in order to centralize the data to maximize the providers profits. Cloud solutions increase the attack surface for malicious hackers to gain access to millions of users' data making it a valuable target.  We need to rethink what  "the cloud" is and that should involve decentralized network solutions. 
- **Mental healthcare in crisis**: According to the World Health Organization (WHO), one in four people in  the world will be affected by mental or neurological disorders at some point in their lives. Currently, around 450 million people suffer from such conditions, making mental disorders among the leading causes of poor health and disability worldwide.

In response to these problems, we propose the creation of a Public Interest Technology organization, Fosfor, which will aim to develop open, transparent, and community driven technologies that truly serve the public interest and improve health outcomes for it's users.

## Organizational Structure:

The fosfor collective is provisionally structured on the principles of "sociocracy", which fosters a collaborative, transparent, and inclusive environment. Our organizational structure is designed to empower all members, promote effective communication, and distribute decision-making authority.

- **Leadership Team**: The leadership team consists of circle leaders elected by their respective circles, ensuring that they have the support and trust of their peers. The leadership team is responsible for overseeing the overall direction and strategy of the collective, as well as providing support and guidance to the individual circles.
- **Staff and Volunteers**: Our staff and volunteers are organized into semi-autonomous, self-organizing circles based on functional areas, projects, or teams. Each circle is responsible for managing its own domain and making decisions within its scope of authority.
- **Governance Structure**: The governance structure is built around the principles of consent decision-making and double-linking. Decisions are made at the circle level through a process of discussion, feedback, and consent from all members. This ensures that all perspectives are considered and no objections are left unaddressed.
  - **Double linking** connects circles by having each circle elect a leader and a representative to participate in the next higher circle's meetings. This ensures proper communication and coordination between circles and helps distribute power evenly.
  - **Roles and Decision making Authority**: Roles within the organization, such as circle leaders and representatives, are assigned through a consent-based election process involving nominations, discussions, and feedback rounds. This ensures that individuals in these roles have the support and trust of their peers.
  - **Decision making authority is distributed among the circles**, with each circle responsible for making decisions within its domain. Higher-level decisions that affect the entire collective are made through collaboration between circle leaders and representatives in a higher circle, ensuring that all voices are heard and considered.

By adopting a sociocratic organizational structure, our non-profit technology collective aims to create a more agile, adaptive, and responsive organization that values the contributions and insights of all its members. This structure promotes a culture of collaboration, continuous improvement, and shared learning, ultimately driving the success and impact of our collective.
